## Hello üëã

I'm a developer with experience in software consulting, management, and development of Time & Attendance, Access, Crypto, APIs, and other projects.
Currently, I work as a Software Architect at [SPEC, SA](https://www.grupospec.com/es), Tech Lead at [TACH LA](https://tach.la), and Co-Founder of [ELEDE Group](https://grupoelede.com), leading and contributing to projects across Argentina, LATAM, and Europe.


## Projects

Throughout my personal career I have collaborated on multiple projects, both development and consulting. A large part of the projects are Open Source, but for political reasons access to the source code is controlled.
